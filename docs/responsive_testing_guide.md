# Responsive Design Testing Guide

## Test the Enhanced TALYX Interface

**File to Open:** `prototype/index.html`

### 1. Responsive Header Test
**Test different screen sizes:**
- **Desktop (1200px+):** All controls in one row
- **Tablet (768px):** Header splits into two rows, controls centered
- **Mobile (640px):** All controls stack vertically

**How to test:**
1. Open prototype/index.html in browser
2. Resize browser window from wide to narrow
3. Verify all buttons remain visible and functional
4. Test language toggles, highlighting toggle, and dev controls

### 2. Enhanced Vocabulary Cards Test
**Features to test:**
- **Visual indicators:** Look for â–¼ arrows on expandable cards
- **Multiple expansions:** Click multiple vocabulary cards simultaneously
- **Content layout:** Verify additional content appears below (not to the right)
- **Chapter information:** Check for "ðŸ“– Chapter 1: The Missing Phone"
- **Usage examples:** Blue-highlighted sentence examples
- **Linguistic notes:** Green-highlighted tips with ðŸ’¡ icon

**Test steps:**
1. Scroll to vocabulary panel at bottom
2. Click on "tÃ©lÃ©phone portable" card - should expand with chapter info
3. Click on "disparu" card while first is open - both should be expanded
4. Click expand arrows to toggle individual cards
5. Test on mobile screen size

### 3. Responsive Grid Test
**Grid behavior:**
- **Desktop:** Multiple columns automatically fit
- **Tablet:** Fewer columns, cards still readable
- **Mobile:** Single column for optimal readability

### 4. Language Toggle Test
- **Both:** Shows French and English with proper contrast
- **French:** Shows only French text, hides English
- **English:** Shows only English text with full brightness, hides French

### 5. Highlighting System Test
- **With highlights:** Dotted underlines on vocabulary/grammar
- **Without highlights:** Click "âœ¨ No Highlights" to disable
- **Toggle functionality:** Button should change to show current state
